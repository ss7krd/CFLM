CLIENT1
=======

Weights [.5, .5] after first epoch

CLIENT2 
=======

Weights [.7, .8] after first epoch 

AVG
===

WEIGHTS [.6, .65] 

CLIENT1
=======

Starts from [.6, .65] on first half of data 

CLIENT2
=======

Starts from [.6, .65] on second half of data 

TASK 
====

1. Loop for each client

* Load previous epoch weight - except on first, where weights are random 
* Train for one epoch 

2. Scalability for clients 

* Number of clients should be a hyperparameter

e.g. get_weights(num_clients: Int)
